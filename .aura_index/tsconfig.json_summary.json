      "The `references` array, which points to `./tsconfig.app.json` and `./tsconfig.node.json`, indicating that this project has separate TypeScript configurations for different environments or build targets (e.g., application code and Node.js specific code).",
      "The `compilerOptions` section, which sets various TypeScript compiler behaviors. Notable settings include `baseUrl` for module resolution, `paths` for aliasing `@/*` to `./src/*`, and several options (`noImplicitAny`, `noUnusedParameters`, `noUnusedLocals`, `strictNullChecks`) set to `false`, indicating a less strict type-checking environment. It also enables `allowJs` and `skipLibCheck`."
    ],
    "summary": "This `tsconfig.json` serves as the main TypeScript configuration for a project, orchestrating compilation by referencing `tsconfig.app.json` and `tsconfig.node.json`. It defines a base URL and path aliases, and configures the TypeScript compiler with relaxed type-checking rules (e.g., allowing implicit 'any' and unused variables, disabling strict null checks) while enabling JavaScript file inclusion and skipping library type checks."
