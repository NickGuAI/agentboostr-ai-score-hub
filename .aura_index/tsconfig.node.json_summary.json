    ],
    "summary": "This `tsconfig.node.json` file configures TypeScript for a Node.js context, specifically targeting `vite.config.ts`. It uses modern JavaScript features (ES2022/ES2023), is optimized for bundlers with `moduleResolution: 'bundler'` and `noEmit: true`, and enforces strict type-checking while allowing unused local variables and parameters. This setup is typical for build configuration files where TypeScript is used but the final JavaScript output is handled by a tool like Vite."
