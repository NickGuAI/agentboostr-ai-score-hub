      "Linting options (strict, noUnusedLocals, noUnusedParameters, noImplicitAny, noFallthroughCasesInSwitch): All set to false, indicating a permissive linting setup.",

      "include: Specifies that all files within the 'src' directory should be included in the compilation."
    ],
    "summary": "This `tsconfig.app.json` file configures the TypeScript compiler for an application, likely a React project due to JSX support. It targets ES2020, uses ESNext modules with a bundler-friendly resolution, and includes source files from the 'src' directory. The configuration has relaxed linting rules and sets up path aliases for easier imports."
