    "summary": "This configuration file for a Supabase project (ID: nzwnbkayxdnutozjiecl) outlines several serverless functions primarily for integrating with Stripe and Google Analytics 4. A key aspect of this configuration is that JWT verification is disabled for all listed functions, suggesting they are intended for public access or rely on alternative authentication mechanisms."
