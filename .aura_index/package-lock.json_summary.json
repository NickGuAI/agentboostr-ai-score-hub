Its primary purpose is to record the exact versions and dependency tree of all installed packages (both direct and transitive) for the 'vite_react_shadcn_ts' project. This ensures that anyone installing the project dependencies will get the identical set of packages, leading to consistent builds across different environments.",

    "summary": "This `package-lock.json` file serves as a manifest for the 'vite_react_shadcn_ts' project's Node.js dependencies. It meticulously records the precise versions and cryptographic hashes of every package, from top-level dependencies like React, Radix UI, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS, down to their sub-dependencies. This detailed record guarantees that future installations of this project will use the exact same dependency tree, preventing potential 'works on my machine' issues and ensuring build consistency."
